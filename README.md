# Sibling App for [Express API server boilerplate](https://github.com/trevorkirpaul/boilerplate--express-api-auth)

Following Grider's udemy course, I created this client side app using React. It connects to the [express api boilerplate](https://github.com/trevorkirpaul/boilerplate--express-api-auth).

### Things To Consider:

1. The course uses an outdated version of Redux Form and React Router.
2. This is mainly a quick test for the server. I wanted to reinforce how I handle client side authentication. This project didn't help as much as I wanted but it was definitely worth doing.

I mainly learned how to use Redux-Form and how to do client-side auth a different (mostly better) way, especially compared to my bartr app.

Previously, I didn't utilize the catch from try/catch from axios and my error handeling on both server and client side were very simple and under developed. This entire project shined a brighter light on how I can send error responses in a more official way.
